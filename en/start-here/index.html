				<h1>What's this all about?</h1>
				<p>We want a web that is open, accessible and ours. In order to achieve that, more of us need to understand its basic mechanics, its culture and what it means to be a citizen of the web. Webmaker Training is part of Mozilla's commitment to help educators and others teach vital web literacy skills. 

Everything here is 100% free, open source and powered by a global community of people like you who want to teach digital and web skills in ways that are creative, participatory and fun. #TeachTheWeb</p>
