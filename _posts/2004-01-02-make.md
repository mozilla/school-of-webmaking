# Advocating for Net Neutrality: Make Your Voice Heard

### 1. Teach and Learn about Net Neutrality with friends and family
<strong>Make a poster or a meme about Net Neutrality with your friends and family.</strong> <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/LTIwMDkzMzEyMA==/host-a-maker-party-net-neutrality">Here's a helpful guide</a> on how to do it. Share your make and give other makers constructive feedback in <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/net-neutrality">course discussion</a>. These small "teach-ins" are called Maker Parties.

### 2. Remix something for Net Neutrality
<strong>Make a open educational resource</strong> designed to teach something about Net Neutrality to someone you care about. Try finding someone to collaborate with, and make something epic. Great activities made during this training have a chance to be added to the <a href="https://keyboardkat.makes.org/thimble/LTQzNjIwNzM2MA==/net-neutrality-teaching-kit">Net Neutrality Teaching Kit</a>!

<div class="gallery">
<div class="make-gallery row"></div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
			var gallery = new MakeGallery(
			{
				tagPrefix: "webmaker:netneutrality-makeprompt",
				limit: 3
			},
			".make-gallery",
			{
	    		apiURL: "https://makeapi.webmaker.org",
                hidden: ["tags", "description"]
			});
</script>

<strong>Remix the <a href="https://keyboardkat.makes.org/thimble/LTQzNjIwNzM2MA==/net-neutrality-teaching-kit">Net Neutrality Teaching Kit</a></strong>, associated activities, or <a href="http://webmaker.org/tools">start from scratch</a>.

### 3. Sign a petition and argue its relevance
Petitions and emails are a great way to apply pressure to policy makers. Tell them to do the right thing to protect net neutrality.

* Decide whether to sign <a href="https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/protect-net-neutrality">Mozilla's petition</a> and if so, explain your personal reasons for why or why not in the <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/net-neutrality">course discussion</a>. 

### 4. File your very first FCC complaint!
The more the FCC hears directly from people, the better it will be to protect the Web. You can file your comments either online or via mail. When you comment, don't forget to tell the FCC why Net Neutrality is important to you.

* You can use the EFF's <a href="https://www.dearfcc.org/">"Dear FCC" template</a> or <a href="http://consumerist.com/2014/05/15/how-to-tell-the-fcc-exactly-what-you-think-about-the-proposed-net-neutrality-rule/">the Consumerist guide</a> to file FCC complaint. You can see *all* <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28">filed complaints</a> on this issue. 
* Freeform your complaint at <a href="http://fcc.gov/comments">http://FCC.gov/comments</a> or email openinternet@fcc.gov
* If you prefer to submit via mail or in person, you can mail your comments to: 
	
	FCC Secretary Marlene H. Dortch  
	445 12th Street, SW Room  TW-B204  
	Washington, DC 20554  
	

	Or, you can hand deliver them to 
	
	236  Massachusetts  Ave., NE  
	Suite 110  
	Washington, DC 20002 

	between 8 a.m.  and 7 p.m. ET. But don't bring anything in an envelope or box, or they won't take it!

* Once you've submitted, share your complaint in the <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/net-neutrality">course discussion</a>. 

### 5. Write a Letter to the Editor of your local newspaper
<a href="https://openmedia.org/slowlane/letter"><img src="https://openmedia.org/sites/default/files/ltte-slowlane1180x260.png"></a>
Open Media has created a <a href="https://openmedia.org/slowlane/letter">letter-to-the-editor tool</a> that you can use to write a letter to your local newspaper. Let's make sure Congress members know how their voters feel about Net Neutrality. If Net Neutrality isn't an issue in your country, perhaps you would like to write a letter to a US paper and explain how your country has kept the web open?

### 6. Organize a larger Net Neutrality Maker Party
<a href="https://events.webmaker.org/#!/event-guides">Organize a bigger event</a> to #TeachTheWeb and Net Neutrality. We have tons of <a href="http://party.webmaker.org/resources">resources</a> to help, and you can get personal advice in <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org">our community discussion</a>.

- Pick a date and put it in <a href="https://events.webmaker.org/#!/">the calendar</a>.
- Contact local <a href="http://mozillians.org">Mozillians</a>, like-minded organizations and/or individuals in your area, ask them to collaborate on a #NetNeutrality <a href="http://party.webmaker.org">#MakerParty</a>, or just invite people to come!
- Use <a href="https://keyboardkat.makes.org/thimble/LTQzNjIwNzM2MA==/net-neutrality-teaching-kit">the Net Neutrality teaching kit</a> for your event agenda, or remix it to personalize your event.
