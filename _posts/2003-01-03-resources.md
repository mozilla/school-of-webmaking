##Building Communities

###Importance of Participation

>Participation creates buy-in. Without participation, a person’s attachment to the community is weak if it exists at all.

>Participation creates opportunities for the other factors. Without participation, connections and empathy will not crystallize.

-Alex Hillman, ["The Experience of Community – Alex Hillman on Listening, Building and Doing"](http://thecommunitymanager.com/2013/01/14/the-experience-of-community-alex-hillman/)

>In cultures of participation, not 
every participant must contribute, 
but all participants must have 
opportunities to contribute when 
they want to...

Gerhard Fischer, [“Understanding, Fostering, and Supporting Cultures of Participation”](http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~gerhard/papers/2011/interactions-coverstory.pdf) 

>I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to <em>ask for help</em> because I saw it work, on the street.

###Provide Ways to Engage

>When coordinated to work together, organizations can provide opportunities beyond what they can do on their own. When networked in this manner, learning experiences are connected, extensive, easily accessed and align with local interests.

-the Hive Community, [Hive Cookbook](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/HiveCookbook)

>Learners differ in the ways that they can navigate a learning environment and express what they know. For example, individuals with significant movement impairments (e.g., cerebral palsy), those who struggle with strategic and organizational abilities (executive function disorders), those who have language barriers, and so forth approach learning tasks very differently. Some may be able to express themselves well in written text but not speech, and vice versa. It should also be recognized that action and expression require a great deal of strategy, practice, and organization, and this is another area in which learners can differ. In reality, there is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners; providing options for action and expression is essential. 

-David Rose. ["Universal Design for Learning"](http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines/principle2)
