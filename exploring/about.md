*“We teach the web in our everyday lives so that future generations can tell their own stories.”*

Welcome to [#teachtheweb](https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&src=typd&f=realtime). We’re glad you’re here. If you’re new to the Mozilla Webmaker community, here is sample of what’s in store:

## What’s [#teachtheweb](https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&src=typd&f=realtime)?

A nifty blended learning initiative by [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), peer-powered by [P2PU](https://p2pu.org/en/). This course is free and open and will be repeating periodically. Read about the very first [#teachtheweb here](http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/).

## What will I do here?

We’re here to help you integrate digital making and web skills into your teaching practice with collaborative, peer-to-peer methodologies. You’ll be learning the community-driven pedagogies behind Webmaker by building things yourself, sharing them with others, and starting to teach the world the web.

Each Module will have 3 parts: you’ll explore, make and reflect--and do so in community.

## Who else is here?

If you’re an educator--in school, in your library, in an afterschool program--and you use technology, welcome home. You’re among other passionate folks who do the same stuff, and here to help. 

## How do I participate?

Participating is learning. How much you dig in is entirely up to you. You’ll get something out of it every step of the way. A few general ideas.
* Share your ideas and weekly “makes” in the [Teach the Web G+ Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205/stream/4723a453-f65d-49c4-a44e-cae2b9dbada1).
* Find your crew. Look at the intros and makes and follow 2-3 people who sound interesting to you during the course.
* Tag your posts [#teachtheweb](https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&src=typd&f=realtime) on Twitter.
* Recommend other resources in the G+ Community by tagging #ttwresources

You aren’t alone, and there are no mistakes. In fact, here’s your network of support in #teachtheweb.
