“We teach the web in our everyday lives so that future generations can tell their own stories.”

Welcome to #teachtheweb. We’re glad you’re here. If you’re new to the Mozilla Webmaker community, here is sample of what’s in store:

## What’s #teachtheweb?**

A nifty blended learning initiative by Mozilla, peer-powered by P2PU. This course is free and open and will be repeating periodically. Read about the very first #teachtheweb here.

## What will I do here?**

We’re here to help you integrate digital making and web skills into your teaching practice with collaborative, peer-to-peer methodologies. You’ll be learning the community-driven pedagogies behind Webmaker by building things yourself, sharing them with others, and starting to teach the world the web.

Each Module will have 3 parts: you’ll explore, make and reflect--and do so in community. 


## Who else is here?**

If you’re an educator--in school, in your library, in an afterschool program--and you use technology, welcome home. You’re among other passionate folks who do the same stuff, and here to help. 

## How do I participate?

Participating is learning. How much you dig in is entirely up to you. You’ll get something out of it every step of the way. A few general ideas.
